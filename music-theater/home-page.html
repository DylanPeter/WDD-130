                Our music theatres require a range of equipment to provide high-quality performances for their audiences. 
                At the heart of our setup is the sound system, which typically includes a mixing console, amplifiers, and a variety of speakers to ensure that every note is heard clearly throughout the venue. 
                Additionally, the lighting system is essential for creating an immersive atmosphere and can include spotlights, wash lights, and color-changing fixtures. The stage itself may also be outfitted with equipment such as microphones, 
                monitors, and instrument amplifiers to ensure that every musician and performer can hear themselves and their fellow performers clearly. Overall, the equipment at a music theatre is designed to enhance the musical experience and create a 
                memorable performance for all who attend.
